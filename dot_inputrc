# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Use more intelligent Up/Down behaviour: use the text that has already been
# typed as the prefix for searching through commands, like in Vim.

# Do not expand "~" to the home directory when completing. (The actual value
# passed on to the command still is expanded, though. Which is good.) "Off" is
# the default value, but some servers override this, so I override the override.

# Be more intelligent when autocompleting by also looking at the text after
# the cursor. For example, when the current line is "cd ~/src/mozil", and
# the cursor is on the "z", pressing Tab will not autocomplete it to "cd
# ~/src/mozillail", but to "cd ~/src/mozilla". (This is supported by the
# Readline used by Bash 4.)
