# My ZSH Configuration without Plugins

All `Oh-my-ZSH` and other frameworks/plugin managers do for `zsh` is managing
other shell scripts that add functionality.

Since I want to know exactly what is running in my shell and keep things to a minimum, I forgo using them.
Instead, any functionality I add will be written into a script or copied directly into my 'zsh' configuration without any uneccessary middlemen or files.

**'*@'** scripts were copied directly from plugins.
